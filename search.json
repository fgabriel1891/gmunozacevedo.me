    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study of ecological networks has progressively evolved from a mostly descriptive science to one that attempts to elucidate the processes governing the emerging structure of multitrophic communities. To move forward, we propose a conceptual framework using trait-based inference of ecological processes to improve our understanding of network assembly and our ability to predict network reassembly amid global change. The framework formalizes the view that network assembly is governed by processes shaping the composition of resource and consumer communities within trophic levels and those dictating species’ interactions between trophic levels. To illustrate the framework and show its applicability, we (1) use simulations to explore network structures emerging from the interactions of these assembly processes, (2) develop a null model approach to infer the processes underlying network assembly from observational data, and (3) use the null model approach to quantify the relative influence of bottom-up (resource-driven) and top-down (consumer-driven) assembly modes on plant-frugivore networks along an elevational gradient. Simulations suggest that assembly processes governing the formation of pairwise interactions have a greater influence on network structure than those governing the composition of communities within trophic levels. Our case study further shows that the mode of network assembly along the gradient is mainly bottom-up controlled, suggesting that the filtering of plant traits has a larger effect on network structure relative to the filtering of frugivore traits. Combined with increasingly available trait and interaction data, the framework provides a timely toolbox to infer assembly processes operating within and between trophic levels and to test competing hypotheses about the assembly mode of resource-consumer networks along environmental gradients and among biogeographic regions. It is a step toward a more process-based network ecology and complete integration of multitrophic interactions in the prediction of future biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ecological network illustrating multitrophic interactions along an elevational gradient, emphasizing trait-based processes and the influence of bottom-up and top-down controls on biodiversity assembly.

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnoscientific approaches offer valuable tools for exploring human–nature relationships, making them useful for developing effective conservation strategies. Raptors, which are birds of prey, face significant conservation threats worldwide, with human persecution being a leading factor in their population decline. Urgent conservation strategies are needed, particularly in regions of high raptor diversity like the tropical Andes. In this study, we employed semistructured questionnaires and logistic models to investigate how demographic factors, economic activity, and traditional knowledge shape people’s perceptions of raptors in rural communities of the Ecuadorian Andes. These communities have historically experienced poverty and inequality, and our approach takes into account their local realities to provide conservation recommendations. Our findings reveal that traditional ecological knowledge provides a broad understanding of human–raptor relations, and that raptors are viewed as both providers of ecosystem services and disservices. Additionally, social demographics, such as gender and educational level, can influence people’s perception of raptors. Based on these results, we can promote conservation actions from a local to global level. Ethnoecological approaches offer diverse conservation opportunities that can vary based on different local contexts. In addition to conventional measures such as environmental education programs, poultry management, and landscape preservation, it is essential to consider the political ecology of specific sites, particularly in regions of the Global South where poverty and inequality are closely intertwined with social and environmental injustices. As such, policy making to alleviate poverty and inequality in rural communities in Ecuador and other Andean countries; and science decolonization to make conservation more inclusive are crucial for human well-being and successful and lasting conservation actions for raptors and biodiversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndepiction of rural communities in the tropical Andes interacting with raptors, highlighting their ecological significance and the balance between conservation and traditional knowledge.

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiologists have long been fascinated by the processes that give rise to phenotypic complexity of organisms, yet whether there exist geographical hotspots of phenotypic complexity remains poorly explored. Phenotypic complexity can be readily observed in ant colonies, which are superorganisms with morphologically differentiated queen and worker castes analogous to the germline and soma of multicellular organisms. Several ant species have evolved ‘worker polymorphism’, where workers in a single colony show quantifiable differences in size and head-to-body scaling. Here, we use 256 754 occurrence points from 8990 ant species to investigate the geography of worker polymorphism. We show that arid regions of the world are the hotspots of superorganism complexity. Tropical savannahs and deserts, which are typically species-poor relative to tropical or even temperate forests, harbour the highest densities of polymorphic ants. We discuss the possible adaptive advantages that worker polymorphism provides in arid environments. Our work may provide a window into the environmental conditions that promote the emergence of highly complex phenotypes."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nAim\nTo synthesize published knowledge on palm–frugivore seed dispersal observations and to test whether broad-scale differences in geographic coverage, diversity, composition and functional structure of plant–animal interactions emerge between biogeographical regions.\n\n\nLocation\nNeotropics and Afrotropics.\n\n\nMethods\nWe constructed a meta-network for both regions by aggregating observations of pairwise palm–frugivore interactions from the primary literature. We assessed sampling completeness with accumulation curves and estimated knowledge gaps for individual palm species and geographic units within biogeographical regions. We compared the taxonomic composition as well as structural indices of regional interaction networks and tested whether functional trait matching (i.e., the relationship between palm fruit size and frugivore body size) differs between regions.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 750 unique pairwise interaction records were retrieved from the primary literature covering 340 frugivores and 126 palms. Sampling completeness of frugivore interactions within biogeographical regions and for individual palm species was low (often &lt;50%), geographic coverage limited, and relative knowledge gaps were largest in areas with high palm species richness. Interaction diversity and network modularity was larger in the Neotropics than the Afrotropics. A positive fruit size–body mass relationship (i.e., functional trait matching) was statistically significant in the Afrotropics, but not in the Neotropics.\n\n\nMain conclusions\nAvailable data on palm–frugivore interactions suggest major biogeographical differences in ecological networks among regions, even when taking differences in palm species richness into account. The Neotropics showed a larger interaction diversity and more modular network structure than the Afrotropics. Broad-scale morphological trait matching among plants and frugivores was only observed in the Afrotropics. The lack of a Neotropical trait matching relationship might be driven by the late Quaternary extinctions of mammalian megafauna in this region. Although our work has increased the digital availability of palm–frugivore interaction observations, massive knowledge gaps of interaction diversity remain in the tropics."

    "text": "Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground\nSpecies around the globe are shifting their ranges into new territories at an unprecedented rate. In particular, the spread of foundation species can transform recipient communities and ecosystems, however, the effects on belowground processes and diversity remain poorly documented. Belowground fungi are well suited for taking the ‘pulse’ of changing ecosystems given their rapid turnover and implication in a wide variety of ecosystem processes. To better understand the belowground effects of range-expanding species, we leveraged an ongoing invasion of a foundation tree species Pinus contorta into alpine tundra to study the impacts on belowground abiotic conditions and the fungal communities associating with the roots of resident plants. We found that individual range-expanding trees create distinct abiotic ‘islands’ with wetter soils and altered soil nutrients compared to the surrounding alpine tundra ecosystem. Potentially driven by these abiotic changes, we observed a decrease in the α diversity of mutualistic fungi and an increase in the α-diversity of pathogenic fungi during later stages of range expansion. Changes in γ-diversity mirrored patterns of α diversity while β-diversity was only minorly affected by range-expanding trees, suggesting that local habitat amelioration/deterioration rather than changes in among-patch heterogeneity underpin trends in belowground diversity. In sum, our results show that range-expanding foundation species can modify ecosystems by altering belowground abiotic conditions and diversity across scales. These impacts begin only a few years after initial range-expansion and establishment and scale rapidly over time, indicating the need for preventative or swift conservation action to prevent long-term consequences."
